Project Description
Code Catalysts is a Web3 Decentralised Publishing & Content Sharing Platform.

We are building a transparent and authentic content ecosystem to provide instant creator rewards. The platform uses smart contracts for automated transactions, assigns a unique Content NFT to every file for originality checking, and employs token-gated access with time limits. Our solution empowers creators with fair recognition and direct, intermediary-free payments from their audience.
